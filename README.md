# Crop-Recommendation-System-using-machine-learning-
Develop a Crop Recommendation System using Python and advanced machine learning libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The system will analyze key agricultural parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation.

The project will feature:

Data preprocessing and exploration

Training multiple ML models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)

Model evaluation and selection

Web-based user interface using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Optional: Data visualization and interactive charts for insights

This system will assist farmers and agricultural planners in making informed crop choices, enhancing productivity and sustainability.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Data Preparation & Model Building
Collect Dataset

Use Kaggleâ€™s crop recommendation dataset or similar
Features: N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall
Target: Crop name

Data Preprocessing

Check for nulls, outliers, and normalize features

Encode target labels (LabelEncoder)

Model Training

Algorithms to try:

Random Forest (great baseline)

Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, KNN (for experimentation)

Use train_test_split() and evaluate using accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
